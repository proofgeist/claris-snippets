# Claris Snippets for Raycast

This repository contains a collection of Claris (FileMaker) Snippets that can be used by [this Raycast extension](https://www.raycast.com/eluce2/claris-snippets). To learn more about how the extension works, check out our blog post.

## Pre-requisites
- Raycast (macOS only) ([direct download](https://www.raycast.com/download))
- Claris Snippets extension ([link to store](https://www.raycast.com/eluce2/claris-snippets))
- FileMaker Pro or Claris Pro

## Installing these snippets
1. **Clone this repository to your computer**

Use the command line to `cd` into the folder where you want these snippets to live, then run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/proofgeist/claris-snippets.git
```

2. **Add the folder to the Raycast Extension**

Open Raycast and search for the **`Manage Snippet Locations`** command, then select **`Add Location`**. Give the location a name (e.g. "Proof+Geist" and enter the folder path where you cloned the repository)

That's it! Now you view and use these snippets in your own work with the Claris platform.
